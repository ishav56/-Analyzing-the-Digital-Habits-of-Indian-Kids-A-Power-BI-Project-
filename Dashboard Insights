🎯 Analyzing the Digital Habits of Indian Kids – A Power BI Project 📱📊

As screen time becomes an everyday part of children’s lives in India, I wanted to explore how it aligns with recommended health standards. So I developed an interactive dashboard titled:

👉 “Indian Kids Screen Timing Effect” – created using Power BI


---

🔍 Problem:

With rising access to smartphones and digital devices, many children are exceeding the recommended screen time (1–1.5 hours/day as per WHO/IAP). However, there's often no clear way to visualize and understand:

How much screen time children are getting by age

The type of devices they use (TV, Tablet, Smartphone, Laptop)

Differences based on state, gender, or internet access

Gaps between actual vs recommended screen time



---

🛠 My Solution Using Power BI:

✅ Built a clean, interactive dashboard that provides:

Age-wise comparison of actual vs recommended screen time

Insights on device usage by age and gender

Filters for state, age, and content type for detailed views

Scrollable data cards for deeper insights (like internet access type)


✅ Used Bookmarks and the Selection Pane to:

Enable interactive navigation between pages

Control what visuals appear based on user selections

Create a seamless and dynamic user experience


✅ Key Metrics Displayed:

Total actual average screen time (~40.52K hours)

Count of primary devices used (Smartphone, Tablet, etc.)

Count of communities by internet type (Broadband vs Mobile Data)


✅ Visuals Included:

Bar charts showing device usage by age and gender

Age-wise recommended vs actual screen time comparison

Slicers for customized filtering and drill-down



---

💡 Key Insight:

As children grow older, smartphone usage becomes the dominant device—even in areas with limited broadband access—often pushing total screen time beyond safe limits.

This dashboard helps parents, schools, and health professionals better understand digital habits and identify where intervention may be needed.
